# Morales_CSCI2270_FinalProject

# Summary
In this project, we will be recreating the pygame library in C++. This will be a library that will allow people to create simple games within C++. The library will allow or keypress detection, board creation and implementation of gameplay. It will be an implemented library with some if not all of the pygame capability to allow for games to be created in C++. ***In the interest of time we have decided to make a blackjack game as rewriting the pygame library would take longer than the alotted time. This blackjack game will allow for single-player and multi-player gameplay with a programmed AI for the Dealer as well as a few computer based players.***

# How to run
This program is a library so it is included into a program to allow for more capability in one's code. ***The game is run by asking the user how many players are participating, how many are computer players and how aggressive those players are. All commands are explained in game.***

# Dependencies
References pygame. Found at http://www.pygame.org/news.html ***No longer references pygame, instead references stdlib.h, algorithm, vector, array, random, cstdlib, and ctime libraries. All are include statements.***

# System Requirements
This is a library the commands will primarily be Linux and Windows, but will be usable in all operating systems. ***Game created in a Linux OS but should work for all operating systems.***
